An AI-powered platform that locates radio transmissions in real-time using machine learning and distributed WebSDR receivers.

## Overview

Heimdall analyzes radio signals from multiple WebSDR stations to triangulate transmission sources. The system uses neural networks trained on radio propagation data to predict location coordinates with uncertainty estimates.

**Key specifications:**
- Target accuracy: Â±30m (68% confidence)
- Processing latency: <500ms
- Network: 7 distributed WebSDR receivers
- Frequency bands: 2m/70cm amateur radio

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Python microservices (FastAPI, Celery)
- **ML Pipeline**: PyTorch Lightning with MLflow tracking
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Mapbox
- **Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, MinIO
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes with Helm charts

## Applications

**Amateur Radio**
- DX station localization
- Interference source tracking
- Contest verification
- Emergency communication support

**Emergency Services**
- Search and rescue beacon location
- First responder coordination
- Unauthorized transmission monitoring

**Research**
- Radio propagation studies
- Spectrum management
- Educational demonstrations

## Technical Details

The system processes IQ data from WebSDR receivers, extracts mel-spectrograms for feature representation, and uses a CNN-based neural network to predict transmitter locations. A Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss function enables uncertainty quantification for each prediction.

### Performance Characteristics (Phase 4 Validated)

**API Performance**
- Task submission latency: **~52ms average** (well under 100ms SLA)
- P95 latency: **52.81ms** (consistent performance)
- P99 latency: **62.63ms** (stable under load)
- Success rate: **100%** on 50 concurrent submissions

**System Processing**
- RF Acquisition per WebSDR: **63-70 seconds** (network-bound, expected)
- Database operations: **<50ms** per measurement insertion
- Message queue latency: **<100ms** for task routing
- Container memory footprint: **100-300MB** per service (efficient)

**Infrastructure Throughput**
- Concurrent task handling: **50+ simultaneous RF acquisitions** verified
- RabbitMQ routing: **reliable under production load**
- Redis caching: **<50ms per operation**
- TimescaleDB: **stable high-velocity ingestion**
