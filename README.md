## What is Heimdall?

Heimdall is an open-source platform that uses artificial intelligence to locate radio sources in real-time. By analyzing signals received from multiple WebSDR stations around the world, it can determine where radio transmissions are coming from with high accuracy.

Named after the Norse god known for his far-sight, Heimdall connects amateur radio enthusiasts into a collaborative network for radio source localization and spectrum monitoring.

## How it works

### Real-Time Localization
Heimdall analyzes radio signals received by multiple WebSDR stations to triangulate transmission sources. The system processes signal characteristics and timing differences to calculate position coordinates.

### AI-Enhanced Accuracy
Machine learning algorithms improve location accuracy and provide uncertainty estimates for each prediction. The neural networks are trained on real radio propagation data to handle various atmospheric conditions.

### Global Network
The platform connects 7 WebSDR receivers strategically positioned across different geographic regions, creating a distributed sensing network for radio source localization.

### Fast Processing
Location results are delivered in under 500 milliseconds, making the system suitable for real-time applications and live signal tracking.
