## 🌟 Imagine This...

Picture a world where **every radio transmission** leaves an invisible footprint across the airwaves. Now imagine an **AI guardian** that can follow these footprints back to their source, anywhere in the world, in real-time.

**Heimdall** is that guardian.

Named after the Norse god who could see across all nine realms, our platform transforms the amateur radio hobby into a **global sensing network** capable of pinpointing radio sources with unprecedented accuracy.

## 🎯 What Does Heimdall Do?

### 🔍 **Real-Time Radio Detective**
Ever heard a mysterious signal and wondered "Where is that coming from?" Heimdall **automatically triangulates** the location of any radio transmission using signals received by multiple WebSDR stations across the globe.

### 🧠 **AI-Powered Intelligence**
Our advanced neural networks don't just calculate positions—they understand the **uncertainty** of each prediction, giving you confidence levels and precision estimates that traditional methods simply can't match.

### 🌍 **Global Collaboration**
By connecting **7 strategically placed WebSDR receivers** across different continents, Heimdall creates the world's first **crowd-sourced radio localization network**.

### ⚡ **Lightning Fast**
Get location results in **under 500 milliseconds**. Fast enough for live tracking, emergency response, and real-time interference hunting.
