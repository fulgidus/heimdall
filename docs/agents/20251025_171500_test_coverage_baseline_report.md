- `src/store/authStore.ts` - 97.75% (authentication store)
- `src/store/analyticsStore.ts` - 85.86% (analytics store)

**Low Coverage Areas** (<30% - Priority for improvement):
- `src/services/api/acquisition.ts` - 14.58% ⚠️ (RF acquisition API client)
- `src/services/api/session.ts` - 17.80% ⚠️ (session management API)
- `src/services/api/system.ts` - 13.46% ⚠️ (system status API)
- `src/services/api/websdr.ts` - 25.00% ⚠️ (WebSDR management API)
- `src/services/api/inference.ts` - 29.03% ⚠️ (inference service API)
- `src/store/dashboardStore.ts` - 0% ⚠️ (dashboard state - not tested)
- `src/store/sessionStore.ts` - 0% ⚠️ (session state - not tested)
- `src/store/systemStore.ts` - 0% ⚠️ (system state - not tested)
- `src/store/websdrStore.ts` - 0% ⚠️ (WebSDR state - not tested)
- `src/store/acquisitionStore.ts` - 0% ⚠️ (acquisition state - not tested)

**Zero Coverage (Excluded or Not Tested)**:
- Config files: `vite.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`
- Entry points: `main.tsx`, `App.tsx`
- Public assets: `/public/assets/js/*` (third-party libraries, excluded)

#### Backend (Pytest)
⚠️ **Limited Test Execution**: Only basic import tests run
- Executed: 3/20 test files (services/rf-acquisition/tests/test_basic_import.py)
- Coverage: ~3% (991 statements, only 27 covered)
- Reason: Missing Python dependencies (pydantic-settings, celery, aiohttp, etc.)
- Network issues during pip install (timeouts from PyPI)

**Backend Test Files Available** (not yet run):
- RF Acquisition: 9 test files (unit, integration, E2E)
- Training Service: 3 test files
- Inference Service: 3 test files  
- API Gateway: 2 test files
- Data Ingestion: 2 test files

## Issues Identified

### 1. Frontend Store Testing Gap (Critical)
**Impact**: Store logic (Zustand state management) has 0% coverage for 5 critical stores
**Affected Files**:
- `dashboardStore.ts`, `sessionStore.ts`, `systemStore.ts`, `websdrStore.ts`, `acquisitionStore.ts`

**Root Cause**: Tests use mocked stores from `src/test/mockStoreFactories.ts` instead of testing real store logic

**Truth-First Violation**: ⚠️ Tests bypass real state management logic
**Fix Required**: Create unit tests for store actions, selectors, and state transitions

### 2. API Service Coverage Gap (High Priority)
**Impact**: Frontend API clients have 14-29% coverage
**Affected Files**: All files in `src/services/api/`

**Root Cause**: Tests don't exercise API client logic, likely using mocked responses
**Truth-First Violation**: ⚠️ Network layer not tested with real backend contracts
**Fix Required**: Integration tests with local backend or test harness respecting API contracts

### 3. Backend Dependency Resolution (Blocker)
**Impact**: Cannot run 90% of backend tests
**Root Cause**: PyPI network timeouts during dependency installation

**Options**:
1. Start Docker infrastructure and run tests inside containers
2. Install dependencies in smaller batches
3. Use requirements files per service
4. Defer backend unit tests, prioritize integration tests with Docker

### 4. Conftest.py Naming Conflicts (Backend)
**Impact**: Cannot run pytest across all services simultaneously
**Error**: `ImportPathMismatchError` - multiple `tests.conftest` modules with same name

**Root Cause**: Each service has `tests/conftest.py` with identical module path
**Fix Required**: Make each conftest unique or run tests per service

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Session 1)
1. ✅ **Frontend**: Add unit tests for Zustand stores (dashboard, session, system, websdr, acquisition)
   - Target: Bring store coverage from 21% → 70%
   - Files: 5 store files × ~50 lines each = ~250 lines to cover
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 hours
   - Tests needed: ~15-20 new test cases

2. ✅ **Frontend**: Add integration tests for API services
   - Target: Bring API coverage from 28% → 70%
   - Files: 6 API client files
   - Requires: Mock server or test harness respecting real API contracts
   - Estimated effort: 3-4 hours
   - Tests needed: ~30-40 new test cases

3. ⏳ **Backend**: Start Docker infrastructure for integration testing
   - Command: `docker compose up -d`
   - Verify: 13 containers healthy
   - Run: Integration and E2E tests requiring real services
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 hours (includes troubleshooting)

### Medium-Term Actions (Session 2-3)
4. Add missing edge case tests:
   - Error handling (5xx responses, timeouts, network failures)
   - Invalid data handling
   - Concurrent operations
   - Timezone/locale handling
   - Empty states and loading states

5. Fix backend conftest conflicts:
   - Option A: Rename each conftest with service prefix
   - Option B: Run tests per service directory
   - Option C: Use pytest plugins to namespace

6. Complete backend unit test coverage:
   - Install all dependencies (retry with --no-cache-dir)
   - Run unit tests per service
   - Target: Each service ≥70% unit test coverage

### Long-Term Actions (Session 4+)
7. E2E testing with real backend:
   - Setup: Local backend with seeded test data
   - Playwright tests connecting to real API
   - Verify: Complete user workflows end-to-end

8. CI/CD integration:
   - Add coverage collection to GitHub Actions
   - Set gradual thresholds (50% → 70% → 90%)
   - Fail PR if coverage decreases

9. Performance testing:
   - Load tests for API endpoints
   - Stress tests for concurrent operations
   - Memory leak detection

None at this stage - all items actionable.

## Next Session Plan

### Session 1 Focus: Frontend Store Coverage (Truth-First)
**Goal**: Increase frontend coverage from 48.96% → >55%

**Tasks**:
1. Create unit tests for `dashboardStore.ts` (actions, selectors, state updates)
2. Create unit tests for `sessionStore.ts` (session CRUD, filtering, sorting)
3. Create unit tests for `systemStore.ts` (health checks, metrics)
4. Create unit tests for `websdrStore.ts` (WebSDR management, status updates)
5. Create unit tests for `acquisitionStore.ts` (acquisition tasks, progress tracking)

**Success Criteria**:
- Store coverage: 0% → ≥70% (target: 80%+)
- All new tests verify real Zustand store behavior
- No mocked store instances in unit tests
- Tests verify state mutations, computed values, async actions

**Test Strategy**:
- Use real Zustand stores (not mocks)
- Test initial state, actions, state updates, selectors
- Test async actions with mocked API responses (at HTTP level, not store level)
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Test store subscriptions and reactivity
