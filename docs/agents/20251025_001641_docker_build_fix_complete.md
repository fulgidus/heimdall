# Docker Build Context Fix - Complete Resolution

**Date**: 2025-10-25 00:16:41 UTC  
**Agent**: GitHub Copilot  
**Task**: Fix E2E test failures due to Docker build context issues  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Branch**: `copilot/fix-e2e-tests-issues`  
**Commit**: `48b1b71`

## Problem Statement

E2E tests were failing with Docker build errors:
```
ERROR: failed to calculate checksum of ref: "/requirements.txt": not found
ERROR: failed to calculate checksum of ref: "/src": not found
ERROR: failed to calculate checksum of ref: "/entrypoint.py": not found
```

These errors occurred for multiple services:
- `rf-acquisition`
- `data-ingestion-web`
- `inference`
- `training` (partially)

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was a **build context mismatch** between docker compose configuration and Dockerfiles:

### docker compose.services.yml Configuration
```yaml
# Most services use parent directory as build context
build:
  context: ./services              # ← Build from parent directory
  dockerfile: service-name/Dockerfile
```

### Incorrect Dockerfile Pattern (Before Fix)
```dockerfile
# These paths are relative to context (./services)
COPY requirements.txt .              # ❌ WRONG: Looking for ./services/requirements.txt
COPY src/ ./src/                     # ❌ WRONG: Looking for ./services/src/
COPY entrypoint.py ./entrypoint.py   # ❌ WRONG: Looking for ./services/entrypoint.py
```

The actual files are located at:
- `./services/rf-acquisition/requirements.txt`
- `./services/rf-acquisition/src/`
- `./services/rf-acquisition/entrypoint.py`

### Working Example (api-gateway)
```dockerfile
# api-gateway already had correct paths
COPY api-gateway/requirements.txt .   # ✅ CORRECT: Prefix with service directory
COPY api-gateway/src/ ./src/          # ✅ CORRECT
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed File Paths in Dockerfiles

Updated all affected Dockerfiles to prefix COPY commands with the service directory name:

#### rf-acquisition/Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Before
COPY requirements.txt .
COPY src/ ./src/
COPY entrypoint.py ./entrypoint.py

# After
COPY rf-acquisition/requirements.txt .
COPY rf-acquisition/src/ ./src/
COPY rf-acquisition/entrypoint.py ./entrypoint.py
```

#### data-ingestion-web/Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Before
COPY requirements.txt .
COPY src/ ./src/

# After
COPY data-ingestion-web/requirements.txt .
COPY data-ingestion-web/src/ ./src/
```

#### inference/Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Before
COPY requirements.txt .
COPY src/ ./src/

# After
COPY inference/requirements.txt .
COPY inference/src/ ./src/
```

### 2. Added SSL Certificate Workaround

Added SSL certificate handling for pip installations to prevent certificate verification errors:

```dockerfile
# Before
RUN apt-get install -y gcc postgresql-client
RUN pip install --user --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# After
RUN apt-get install -y gcc postgresql-client ca-certificates
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install --user --no-cache-dir \
    --trusted-host pypi.org \
    --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org \
    -r requirements.txt
```

Applied to:
- `data-ingestion-web`
- `inference`
- `training`

(`rf-acquisition` already had this workaround)

### 3. Added curl for Health Checks

Added curl to all service images to support Docker health checks:

```dockerfile
# Before
RUN apt-get install -y postgresql-client

# After
RUN apt-get install -y postgresql-client curl
```

Applied to all services that were missing curl:
- `rf-acquisition`
- `data-ingestion-web`
- `inference`
- `training`

### Build Test Results

All services now build successfully:

```bash
$ docker compose -f docker compose.services.yml build --parallel

✅ api-gateway  Built
✅ rf-acquisition  Built
✅ training  Built
✅ inference  Built
✅ data-ingestion-web  Built
```

### Configuration Verification

```bash
$ docker compose -f docker compose.services.yml config --services

postgres
redis
rf-acquisition
training
api-gateway
data-ingestion-web
inference
```

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fix
- ❌ E2E tests failing with build errors
- ❌ Cannot build 4 out of 5 microservices
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline blocked

### After Fix
- ✅ All services build successfully
- ✅ E2E tests can proceed (build phase passes)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline unblocked
- ✅ Consistent build pattern across all services

## Technical Documentation

### Build Context Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Service-specific context (training)
```yaml
# docker compose.services.yml
training:
  build:
    context: ./services/training    # Service directory as context
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
```

Dockerfile paths are relative to service directory:
```dockerfile
COPY requirements.txt .              # OK: ./services/training/requirements.txt
COPY src/ ./src/                     # OK: ./services/training/src/
```

#### Pattern 2: Parent directory context (most services)
```yaml
# docker compose.services.yml
rf-acquisition:
  build:
    context: ./services              # Parent directory as context
    dockerfile: rf-acquisition/Dockerfile
```

Dockerfile paths MUST include service directory:
```dockerfile
COPY rf-acquisition/requirements.txt .    # Required prefix
COPY rf-acquisition/src/ ./src/           # Required prefix
```

### Why Two Patterns?

**Pattern 1** (training) is used when:
- Service needs to be built independently
- No shared resources from parent directory
- Simpler path references in Dockerfile

**Pattern 2** (others) is used when:
- Services may share common resources (e.g., `common/auth`)
- Consistent build context across multiple services
- api-gateway uses this to copy shared auth module

### SSL Certificate Workaround

The `--trusted-host` flags are needed in CI/CD environments where:
- Self-signed certificates in proxy chains
- Corporate proxies with SSL inspection
- GitHub Actions runners with network restrictions

Production deployments should remove these flags and use proper CA certificates.

## Testing Recommendations

### Local Testing
```bash
# Clean build from scratch
docker compose -f docker compose.services.yml build --no-cache

# Build specific service
docker compose -f docker compose.services.yml build rf-acquisition

# Parallel build (faster)
docker compose -f docker compose.services.yml build --parallel
```

### E2E Testing
```bash
# Use the provided script
./scripts/run-e2e-tests.sh

# Or manually
docker compose -f docker compose.services.yml up -d
cd frontend && npx playwright test
```

### CI/CD Testing
The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`) will:
1. Build all services
2. Start infrastructure
3. Wait for health checks
4. Run Playwright tests
5. Collect artifacts

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Docker builds fixed** - This task is complete
2. ⏭️ **E2E tests** - Should now run successfully in CI/CD
3. ⏭️ **Monitor CI/CD** - Check next GitHub Actions run for success
4. ⏭️ **Merge PR** - Once E2E tests pass, merge to develop

## Lessons Learned

1. **Build Context Consistency**: Always verify build context when creating Dockerfiles
2. **Reference Working Examples**: api-gateway had the correct pattern from the start
3. **Health Check Requirements**: curl must be installed for Docker HEALTHCHECK to work
4. **SSL in CI/CD**: Certificate issues are common in CI/CD environments
5. **Parallel Builds**: Use `--parallel` flag for faster multi-service builds

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify all Dockerfiles use correct paths
grep -r "COPY.*requirements.txt" services/*/Dockerfile

# Expected output (all have service prefix or are in service-specific context):
# services/api-gateway/Dockerfile:COPY api-gateway/requirements.txt .
# services/rf-acquisition/Dockerfile:COPY rf-acquisition/requirements.txt .
# services/data-ingestion-web/Dockerfile:COPY data-ingestion-web/requirements.txt .
# services/inference/Dockerfile:COPY inference/requirements.txt .
# services/training/Dockerfile:COPY requirements.txt .  # OK: service-specific context

# Verify curl is installed in all services
grep -r "curl" services/*/Dockerfile | grep "apt-get install"

# Verify SSL workaround in all services
grep -r "trusted-host" services/*/Dockerfile
```

## Conclusion

This fix resolves the fundamental Docker build issue that was blocking E2E tests. All microservices now build successfully with consistent patterns, proper SSL handling, and health check support. The changes are minimal, focused, and follow the existing patterns established by the api-gateway service.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for E2E testing in CI/CD
