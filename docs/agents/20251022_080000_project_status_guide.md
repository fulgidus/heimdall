## 📊 STATUS INTERPRETATION GUIDE

### How to Read AGENTS.md Status Line
```
**Current Status**: Phase 4 - Infrastructure Validation Track (50% - 2/4 tasks complete)
                    ├─ Phase Name: Phase 4
                    ├─ Track: Infrastructure Validation Track (vs UI Implementation Track)
                    ├─ Progress %: 50% complete
                    └─ Tasks: 2 of 4 completed
```

### How to Read Phase Status
```
**Status**: 🟡 IN PROGRESS - Validation Focus
            ├─ 🟡 = IN PROGRESS (work is happening)
            ├─ IN PROGRESS = Actively being worked on
            └─ Validation Focus = Current emphasis/track
```

### How to Read Task Status
```
- **A1**: E2E Test Suite ✅ COMPLETED
  ├─ ✅ = Task fully done (passed validation)
  ├─ E2E Test Suite = Task name/deliverable
  └─ COMPLETED = Status (vs IN PROGRESS, NOT STARTED, etc.)
```

## 🎯 EXAMPLE: How to Update Files for Phase 4 Task A3

### Scenario: Just completed Phase 4 Task A3 (Performance Benchmarking)

#### Step 1: Update AGENTS.md
Find `## 🖥️ PHASE 4:` section and update:
```markdown
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-22 14:30:00 UTC (Session 2 - Task A3 Performance Report Complete)
**Current Status**: Phase 4 - Infrastructure Validation Track (75% - 3/4 tasks complete)

- **A3**: Performance Benchmarking ✅ COMPLETED
  - All API endpoints measured (<100ms latency confirmed)
  - Task execution baseline: 63-70s (network-bound, as expected)
  - Concurrent capacity: 10+ simultaneous tasks verified
  - Inference latency: <500ms requirement verified ✅
  - Report: PHASE4_TASK_A3_PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md
```

#### Step 2: Create PHASE4_TASK_A3_PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md
```markdown
# Performance Benchmarking Report - Phase 4 Task A3

**Date**: 2025-10-22  
**Duration**: 1.5 hours  
**Completed By**: [Agent Name]

## Executive Summary
- ✅ All performance requirements verified
- ✅ Infrastructure suitable for production
- ⚠️ WebSDR network dependency identified (expected)

## Metrics Measured
[Table with API latency, task time, concurrent capacity, etc.]

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Phase 4 Task B1 (Load Testing)
- Start Phase 5 (Training Pipeline) in parallel
```

#### Step 3: Update SESSION_TRACKING.md
```markdown
### Session 2 (continued) Status (2025-10-22 Afternoon)
- ✅ Phase 4 Task A3: Performance Benchmarking completed in 1.5h
- ✅ Performance report generated (PHASE4_TASK_A3_PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md)
- ⏳ Phase 4 Task B1: Load Testing (next, 2-3h)

| Task      | Status     | Time | Result               |
| --------- | ---------- | ---- | -------------------- |
| A3 Report | ✅ Complete | 1.5h | All metrics verified |
```

#### Step 4: Update todo list
```
- [x] Phase 4 Task A3: Performance Benchmarking
  - ✅ COMPLETED 2025-10-22 14:30 UTC - All metrics verified, <500ms inference confirmed
- [ ] Phase 4 Task B1: Load Testing & Stress Testing
  - NEXT TASK - 2-3 hours, no blockers
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL REMINDERS

### ✅ DO's
- ✅ Update timestamps in UTC (use `Get-Date -AsUTC`)
- ✅ Use consistent status indicators (see HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md)
- ✅ Include time estimates for each task
- ✅ Document blockers immediately
- ✅ Create report files for major deliverables
- ✅ Run tests before marking task complete

### ❌ DON'Ts
- ❌ Leave "Last Updated" timestamp stale
- ❌ Mix different status symbols (use 🔴/🟡/🟢, not other colors)
- ❌ Forget to test before marking complete
- ❌ Leave blockers undocumented
- ❌ Commit changes without updating status files
- ❌ Skip SESSION_TRACKING.md at end of session
