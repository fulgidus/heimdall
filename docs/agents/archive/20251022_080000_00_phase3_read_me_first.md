## 💡 Key Innovations

### 1. Concurrent Fetching (7x Speedup!)
```
Sequential: 2100ms (fetch one receiver at a time)
Parallel:   300ms  (fetch all 7 simultaneously)
Speedup:    7x! 🚀
```

### 2. Robust Signal Processing
- Welch's method for smooth PSD
- Automatic SNR calculation
- Frequency offset detection
- Works even with poor signals ✅

### 3. Real-Time Progress Tracking
- FastAPI polls Celery task state
- UI sees "3/7 receivers fetched"
- No need for webhooks
- Simple & reliable ✅

### 4. Error Resilience
- If 1-2 receivers fail, continue
- Collect errors, return partial results
- 5/7 successful still useful
- Better UX ✅
