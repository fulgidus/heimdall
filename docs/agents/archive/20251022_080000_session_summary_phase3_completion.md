## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **SQLAlchemy Connection Pooling**
   - NullPool doesn't work with :memory: databases
   - StaticPool maintains persistent in-memory connections
   - Important for testing

2. **Celery Task Orchestration**
   - Works well for distributed processing
   - Retry mechanisms are essential
   - Progress tracking improves UX

3. **TimescaleDB Integration**
   - Hypertables are excellent for time-series
   - Compression policies save storage
   - Bulk inserts are critical for performance

4. **Test Coverage**
   - 89% is good, 95%+ is excellent
   - Critical paths should be 100%
   - Mock tests can be fragile
