# Integration Tests Fix - MinIO and Keycloak Container Issues

**Date**: 2025-10-24 23:59:00 UTC  
**Agent**: GitHub Copilot  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Related**: Phase 4 Infrastructure Validation

## Problem Statement

Integration tests in GitHub Actions were failing with container initialization errors:

```
Service container minio failed.
Error: Failed to initialize container minio/minio:latest

Service container keycloak failed.
Error: Failed to initialize container quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:23.0
```

Both containers were showing help text instead of starting properly.

## Root Cause Analysis

GitHub Actions service containers **do not support custom commands** in the service definition. The `options` field only accepts Docker run options like health checks, not the command to execute.

### MinIO Issue
- Required command: `server /data --console-address ":9001"`
- Without this command, MinIO just displays help text and exits

### Keycloak Issue  
- Required command: `start-dev`
- Without this command, Keycloak just displays help text and exits

## Solution

Converted both MinIO and Keycloak from GitHub Actions service containers to **manually started containers** in workflow steps. This provides full control over the container startup command.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Removed from Services Section
```yaml
# BEFORE (in services section)
minio:
  image: minio/minio:latest
  options: >-
    --health-cmd "curl -f http://localhost:9000/minio/health/live"
  # ❌ No way to add command here
```

#### 2. Added as Workflow Steps
```yaml
# AFTER (in steps section)
- name: Start MinIO container
  run: |
    NETWORK=$(docker network ls --format '{{.Name}}' | grep github || echo "bridge")
    docker run -d \
      --name minio \
      --network "$NETWORK" \
      -e MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin \
      -e MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin \
      -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 \
      minio/minio:latest \
      server /data --console-address ":9001"  # ✅ Command specified
    
    timeout 60 bash -c 'until curl -sf http://localhost:9000/minio/health/live; do sleep 2; done'
```

### Key Features

1. **Network Auto-Discovery**: Automatically finds the GitHub Actions network for service containers
2. **Health Check Loops**: Waits for services to be fully ready before proceeding
3. **Volume Mounting**: Keycloak realm configuration mounted from repository
4. **Cleanup**: Containers stopped and removed in cleanup step
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to bridge network if GitHub network not found

## Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml`
  - Removed MinIO and Keycloak from services section
  - Added "Start MinIO container" step
  - Added "Start Keycloak container" step with volume mount
  - Updated "Configure Keycloak realm" step to use named container
  - Added cleanup step

## Testing

✅ YAML syntax validation passed
✅ Workflow logic verified against docker-compose.yml
✅ Health check commands validated

## Verification Plan

The fix will be verified when the GitHub Actions workflow runs:

1. **MinIO Health Check**: Should respond at `http://localhost:9000/minio/health/live`
2. **Keycloak Health Check**: Should respond at `http://localhost:8080/health/ready`
3. **Integration Tests**: Should run successfully against both services
4. **Cleanup**: Containers should be stopped and removed

## Lessons Learned

1. **GitHub Actions Limitation**: Service containers cannot specify custom commands
2. **Workaround Pattern**: Use manual container startup in steps for services requiring custom commands
3. **Network Discovery**: GitHub Actions creates a network automatically; find it dynamically
4. **Health Checks**: Always wait for services to be ready before running tests
5. **Cleanup**: Manually started containers need manual cleanup

## Next Actions

- [ ] Monitor first GitHub Actions run with this fix
- [ ] Verify all integration tests pass
- [ ] Update documentation if any issues found
- [ ] Consider applying same pattern to other workflows if needed
