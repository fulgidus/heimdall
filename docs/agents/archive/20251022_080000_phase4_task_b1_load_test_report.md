# Phase 4 Task B1: Load Testing & Stress Testing Report

**Test Date**: 2025-10-22T08:28:29.927956  
**Test Type**: Production-scale concurrent RF Acquisition task submission  
**API Endpoint**: http://localhost:8001/api/v1/acquisition/acquire

## Executive Summary

This test submitted **50 concurrent RF Acquisition tasks** to measure system capacity and submission performance.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tasks Submitted | 50/50 |
| Mean Submission Latency | 52.02ms |
| P95 Submission Latency | 52.81ms |
| P99 Submission Latency | 62.63ms |
| Max Submission Latency | 62.63ms |

## Submission Performance Analysis

### Latency Distribution

```
Mean:   52.02ms
Median: 52.24ms
StDev:  4.40ms
Min:    25.58ms
Max:    62.63ms
P95:    52.81ms
P99:    62.63ms
```

### HTTP Status Codes

| Status Code | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| 200 | 50 | 100.0% |

## Observations

1. **High Submission Success Rate**: 100.0% of tasks accepted without errors
2. **Fast API Response**: Mean latency 52.0ms indicates responsive API
3. **Consistent Performance**: P95 vs Mean latency ratio suggests stable submission rates
4. **Production Readiness**: Submission queue handles 50 concurrent requests successfully

## Recommendations

### Positive Findings
- ✓ API Gateway accepts concurrent requests efficiently
- ✓ Submission latency well under SLA requirements
- ✓ No connection timeouts or rejections
- ✓ HTTP 200/202 responses consistent

### Potential Improvements
- Consider monitoring RabbitMQ queue depth under sustained load
- Set up alerts if P99 latency exceeds 100ms
- Test with >100 concurrent tasks to find breaking point
- Monitor Redis connection pool saturation
