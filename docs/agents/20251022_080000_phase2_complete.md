## Testing & Verification

### Ready for Testing

Each service is ready for:
1. ✅ Local development (`python -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload`)
2. ✅ Docker build (`docker build -t service-name .`)
3. ✅ Docker compose orchestration (`docker compose -f docker compose.services.yml up`)
4. ✅ Unit test execution (`pytest tests/`)

### Docker Build Verification Commands

```bash
# Build individual services
docker build -t heimdall-api-gateway:latest ./services/api-gateway
docker build -t heimdall-rf-acquisition:latest ./services/rf-acquisition
docker build -t heimdall-training:latest ./services/training
docker build -t heimdall-inference:latest ./services/inference
docker build -t heimdall-data-ingestion-web:latest ./services/data-ingestion-web

# Start all services
docker compose -f docker compose.services.yml up --build
```

### Health Check Verification

```bash
# After services are running
curl http://localhost:8000/health   # api-gateway
curl http://localhost:8001/health   # rf-acquisition
curl http://localhost:8002/health   # training
curl http://localhost:8003/health   # inference
curl http://localhost:8004/health   # data-ingestion-web
```

## Issues & Resolutions

### Issue 1: Encoding Problems on Windows
**Problem**: Unicode emoji characters in template strings causing encoding errors
**Resolution**: Removed emoji characters, used plain text messages

### Issue 2: Complex Template Generation
**Problem**: Multi-line string templates with triple quotes causing syntax errors
**Resolution**: Simplified to inline file creation using create_file tool

### Issue 3: Directory Creation
**Problem**: Tests directories not created automatically in some services
**Resolution**: Created manually after service generation
