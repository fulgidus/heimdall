# 📋 AGENT HANDOFF & CONTINUITY PROTOCOL

**Purpose**: Ensure smooth transitions between sessions and maintain project continuity  
**Effective Date**: 2025-10-22  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-22 12:45:00 UTC

---

## 🎯 MANDATORY UPDATE RULES

### Rule 1: Update AGENTS.md After Every Major Milestone
**When**: Immediately after completing a checkpoint or phase task  
**What**: Update these sections:
- `**Last Updated**` timestamp at top
- `**Current Status**` phase and progress percentage
- Relevant phase section with:
  - ✅ Completed tasks
  - ⏳ In-progress items
  - Status line (🟢 COMPLETE / 🟡 IN PROGRESS / 🔴 NOT STARTED)

**Example Update Pattern**:
```markdown
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-22 14:30:00 UTC (Session 2 - Task A3 Performance Report Complete)
**Current Status**: Phase 4 - Performance Benchmarking (75% - 3/4 tasks complete)

[In phase section]
- **A3**: Performance Benchmarking ✅ COMPLETED
  - Report generated with 5 load scenarios
  - API latency: <100ms verified
  - Task execution: 63-70s baseline
  - Concurrent capacity: 10+ tasks verified
```

### Rule 2: Update SESSION_TRACKING.md at End of Each Work Session
**When**: Before switching to another task or ending work session  
**What**: Fill out:
1. **Session Objectives** - What was planned
2. **Tasks Completed** - With time spent
3. **Key Discoveries** - Important findings
4. **Current Status** - Updated metrics
5. **Next Steps** - What's blocked on what
6. **Continuation Notes** - For next agent

**Template**:
```markdown
### Session [N] Status (Date)
- ✅ Task X completed in Yh Zm
- ✅ Task Y completed in Yh Zm
- ⏳ Task Z pending (blocked on [dependency])
- 🔴 Task W failed (reason: [issue])
```

### Rule 3: Create Checkpoints for High-Value Deliverables
**When**: After completing major features or validation tasks  
**What**: Create dated report file:
- Format: `PHASE{N}_TASK_{ID}_{DESCRIPTION}.md`
- Include: Checklist, metrics, known issues, rollback plan
- Example: `PHASE4_TASK_A3_PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md`

### Rule 4: Update Todo List at Each Session Start & End
**When**: 
- Start: Review what was completed last session
- End: Mark completed items, update in-progress items
**What**: Keep sync with actual progress
- Mark ✅ completed items with date
- Mark ⏳ in-progress items with ETA
- Add 🔴 blockers with reason

## 🔍 STATUS INDICATORS GUIDE

### Phase Status Indicators
```
🔴 NOT STARTED      - No work begun
🟡 IN PROGRESS      - Active work
🟢 COMPLETE         - All checkpoints passed
⚠️  BLOCKED          - Waiting on dependency
🔧 PAUSED           - Temporarily stopped, can resume
```

### Task Progress Indicators
```
✅ COMPLETED       - Done, tested, documented
⏳ IN PROGRESS     - Currently working
🔴 NOT STARTED    - Queued
⚠️  BLOCKED        - Waiting on something
❌ FAILED         - Needs fixing
🔧 PARTIAL        - 50-99% done
```

### Infrastructure Status
```
✅ OK              - Fully operational
⚠️  DEGRADED       - Working but issues present
🔴 DOWN            - Service unavailable
❓ UNKNOWN         - Status not verified
🟡 TESTING         - Under validation
```

## 🔄 SESSION WORKFLOW

### Start of Session
1. ✅ Read `AGENTS.md` - Current status section
2. ✅ Read `SESSION_TRACKING.md` - Continuation notes
3. ✅ Read last phase task report (e.g., `PHASE4_TASK_A2_DOCKER_VALIDATION.md`)
4. ✅ Check todo list for priorities
5. ✅ Verify infrastructure health (`docker compose ps`)

### During Session
1. ✅ Update todo list when starting new task
2. ✅ Log progress after major milestones (every 15-30 min)
3. ✅ Document blockers immediately when encountered
4. ✅ Generate reports for completed tasks
5. ✅ Test after every code change

### End of Session
1. ✅ Update `AGENTS.md` with completion status
2. ✅ Update `SESSION_TRACKING.md` with full session details
3. ✅ Verify tests are passing (or document why they're not)
4. ✅ Create checkpoint report if task complete
5. ✅ Update todo list with next priorities
6. ✅ Document blockers for next session

## 🚨 CRITICAL INFORMATION TO ALWAYS TRACK

### Blockers & Dependencies
**If blocked**, immediately document:
- What task is blocked
- What it's blocked on
- Expected unblock date/time
- Workaround (if any)

Example:
```
⚠️ BLOCKED: Phase 5 Training Pipeline
   - Blocked on: Phase 4 A3 Performance Report
   - Expected unblock: 2025-10-22 14:00 UTC
   - Workaround: Can start ML infrastructure setup in parallel
```

### Infrastructure Changes
**If infrastructure modified**, document:
- What changed (e.g., new env var, container added)
- Why it changed
- How to reproduce it
- Date of change

Example:
```
✏️ CHANGE: Added entrypoint.py to rf-acquisition
   - Why: No Celery worker was running
   - Date: 2025-10-22 09:30 UTC
   - How: Created dual-process launcher
   - Verify: docker compose logs rf-acquisition | grep "ready"
```

### Known Issues
**Always track**:
- What the issue is
- Severity (critical/major/minor/cosmetic)
- Expected fix date
- Workaround

Current Known Issues:
```
🟡 COSMETIC: Health check endpoints show "unhealthy"
   - Severity: COSMETIC (infrastructure works fine)
   - Root cause: Health check endpoint not implemented in all services
   - Fix date: Phase 9 (QA & Testing)
   - Workaround: Use docker compose ps instead

🟡 EXTERNAL: WebSDR receivers offline in test environment
   - Severity: EXPECTED (external dependency)
   - Reason: WebSDRs are live internet services
   - Fix: N/A (expected in test, works in production)
   - Workaround: Tests accept PARTIAL_FAILURE status

⏳ PENDING: Inference latency verification
   - Severity: REQUIRED (must verify <500ms)
   - Status: Pending Phase 4 Task A3
   - Target: 2025-10-22 14:00 UTC
```
